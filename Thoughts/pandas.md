# Python Package
### Pandas
There are many things to tell about pandas. First, let me start with NumPy, which is a python package for processing the data that are a collection of numbers in any format (e.g., 2-D Array).  
So, basically Pandas is for Data Analysis, which is a step in Data Science process. Using pandas, Data cleaning and Data processing can be done so easily.  
It can be easily installed using pip as follows:
> pip install pandas
>
So, happy coding with lovely pandas and make your outputs without any struggling !
